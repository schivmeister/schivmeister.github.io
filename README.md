Hello, world! I am Rashif, and it seems you have found my bare-bones
"website". I hope you like reading, because I tend to be very
_wordy_, owing to my habits as a has-been wordsmith and grammar Nazi. If it matters, I have been personality-typed consistently as an [_ENTJ_](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp).

I am a practitioner of [knowledge science](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3448577/who-should-be-responsible-for-your-data-the-knowledge-scientist.html), an emerging subdiscipline of computer science allied with the goals of [explainable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/12/30/explainable-ai-the-rising-role-of-knowledge-scientists/#395937a2603f), [_semantic_](https://www.poolparty.biz/semantic-ai/) artificial intelligence (AI). With a background in [the Semantic Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM6XIICm_qo) and traditional [symbolic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning), I am a graph database specialist fully invested in designing and building computer software backed by semantic technologies, including [ontologies and knowledge graphs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/knowledge-graphs-beyond-the-hype-getting-knowledge-in-and-out-of-graphs-and-databases/), aka Web 3.0 (not to be confused with [Web3](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/web3-vs-web-30-satheeshan-siva/)). I am also a long-time [open-source contributor and Linux enthusiast](https://www.archlinux.org/people/developer-fellows/#schiv); in the past I spent most of my time staring at black screens with green text scrolling endlessly for hours and days.

I mostly "work from home" (WFH) as a consultant, and you may call that "work online", but that would not be entirely
correct. A lot of my work is offline, with pen and paper, not unlike the
situation of many other computer scientists or software engineers. The Internet
and the Web just help us collaborate and communicate very easily and effectively. This is "telecommuting" (US) or "teleworking" (Europe) of the 21<sup>st</sup>
century, and has existed since before the Internet.
