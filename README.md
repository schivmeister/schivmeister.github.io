# schivmeister.github.io

Hello, world! I am Rashif, [0] and it seems you have found my bare-bones
"website".  I am sorry for the utterly plain design, but it is still a
work-in-progress (WIP) due to something called "busy schedule" and "real life".
This page exists thanks to the ease of Git and Github.

I will try to be quick so you can move along, although I tend to be very
_wordy_, owing to my habits as a has-been wordsmith and "grammar Nazi". If it
matters, I have been personality-typed consistently as an "ENTJ", [1] but I am
not very sure how well I'll do leading people or running a business.

What I am these days is a Computer Science practitioner, in a sub-discipline of
_artificial intelligence_ (AI) called "knowledge representation and reasoning", or
simply _KRR_. On the Internet, some applied form of what I do is also known as
the Semantic Web, Web 3.0 and Knowledge Graphs. [2] I work at a startup [3]
wearing multiple hats, so a clear definition of role is difficult. [4]

Aside from _ontology engineering_ my primary function is to figure out patterns
in texts, structure them into a _machine-readable_ form, and determine
practically everything else needed to code/build (primarily in Java) a modern
software- or web-based intelligent agent based on a "top-down" _symbolic AI_
approach. So, mostly, _knowledge engineering_.

It all started thanks to my Computer Science MSc at the University of Leicester
(UK) [5] and a stint with a European stealth FinTech/RegTech [6] startup, which
supported my thesis and grew into an awesome full-time engagement and
friendship with the founder. [7] Fun fact: we are a truly remote, _distributed_
team.

Yes, that means I "work from home" or "work online", but it is not entirely
correct. A lot of my work is offline, on pencil and paper, not unlike the
situation of many other computer scientists or software engineers. The Internet
and the Web helps us collaborate and communicate very easily.

This is "telecommuting" (US) or "teleworking" (Europe) of the 21<sup>st</sup>
century, and has existed since before the Internet. In my free time I moonlight
as a computing mentor on Codementor, [8] where the mentoring or tutoring
happens in real-time live screensharing, voice call or video sessions along
with a code window. So, _online_.

I would not be complete without mentioning my long-time non-profit position as
developer of a Linux distribution, Arch Linux, [9] where I (used to but for
some time no longer actively) maintain niche packages such as for
(semi-)professional audio. [10] This is what you would know as "open-source
contribution", which also happens completely online.

It is very sad that a modern website of a computing professional will be so
text-heavy. I really apologize for this and have tried very hard to stop myself
from writing anymore gibberish.

Abrupt end.

terms of a title, it would be "CTO", but at an early-stage startup titles mean
very little.
