Hello, world! I am Rashif, and it seems you have found my bare-bones
"website". I hope you like reading, because I tend to be very
_wordy_, owing to my habits as a has-been wordsmith. If it matters, I have been personality-typed consistently as an [_ENTJ_](https://www.humanmetrics.com/personality/entj).

I am a practitioner of [knowledge science](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3448577/who-should-be-responsible-for-your-data-the-knowledge-scientist.html), an emerging subdiscipline of computer science allied with the goals of [explainable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/12/30/explainable-ai-the-rising-role-of-knowledge-scientists/#395937a2603f), [_semantic_](https://www.poolparty.biz/learning-hub/semantic-ai/) artificial intelligence (AI). With a background in [the Semantic Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM6XIICm_qo) and traditional [symbolic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning), I am a graph database specialist fully invested in designing and building computer software backed by semantic technologies, including [ontologies and knowledge graphs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/knowledge-graphs-beyond-the-hype-getting-knowledge-in-and-out-of-graphs-and-databases/), aka Web 3.0 (not to be confused with [Web3](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/web3-vs-web-30-satheeshan-siva/)). I am also a long-time [open-source contributor and Linux enthusiast](https://www.archlinux.org/people/developer-fellows/#schiv); in the past I spent most of my time staring at black screens with green text scrolling endlessly for hours and days.

What that all means is that I "work in IT" and, some might say, "in tech", or "in AI". I mostly "telecommute" (or telework) and, some might say, "work from home" (WFH). We have the Internet
and the Web to thank for making collaboration and communication so easy and effective (for the most part). I hear, however, that AI is going to take over most of our jobs, so I'd love to hear about any exciting ideas you have to make the world a better place, before doomsday comes.
